```
Scenario 1: Valid OutputStream Passed to MimeCanonicalOutputStream

Details:
  TestName: outputStreamInitialization
  Description: This test checks if MimeCanonicalOutputStream correctly initializes with a valid OutputStream without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ByteArrayOutputStream to use as the underlying OutputStream.
  Act: Instantiate MimeCanonicalOutputStream using the ByteArrayOutputStream.
  Assert: No exception is thrown and the MimeCanonicalOutputStream instance is successfully created.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the constructor handles valid input correctly. This is significant as it ensures the class can be reliably used to wrap other OutputStreams in application components that handle MIME encoding.

Scenario 2: Null OutputStream Passed to MimeCanonicalOutputStream

Details:
  TestName: outputStreamInitializationWithNull
  Description: This test verifies that passing a null OutputStream to MimeCanonicalOutputStream throws a NullPointerException.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the OutputStream input as null.
  Act: Attempt to instantiate MimeCanonicalOutputStream with the null OutputStream.
  Assert: Expect a NullPointerException to be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion checks for proper handling of null values, ensuring robustness in the constructor's implementation. It is crucial to prevent the application from proceeding with a null OutputStream, which could lead to further errors in MIME data processing.

Scenario 3: OutputStream Throws IOException on Write

Details:
  TestName: outputStreamWriteExceptionHandling
  Description: This test checks how MimeCanonicalOutputStream handles scenarios where the underlying OutputStream throws an IOException on write operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an OutputStream to throw an IOException when the write method is called.
  Act: Wrap this mock OutputStream with MimeCanonicalOutputStream and perform a write operation.
  Assert: Expect that the IOException is propagated through MimeCanonicalOutputStream.
Validation:
  This test confirms that MimeCanonicalOutputStream does not suppress exceptions from the underlying stream, maintaining transparency about I/O errors. It is essential for error handling and debugging in higher-level components that use this stream for MIME data output.

Scenario 4: OutputStream Close Operation

Details:
  TestName: outputStreamCloseBehavior
  Description: Test to ensure that closing MimeCanonicalOutputStream also closes the underlying OutputStream.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an OutputStream and track its close operation.
  Act: Create a MimeCanonicalOutputStream with this mock, perform operations, and then close the MimeCanonicalOutputStream.
  Assert: Verify that the close method on the mocked OutputStream was called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that resources are appropriately managed by MimeCanonicalOutputStream by closing the underlying stream. Proper resource management is critical to prevent resource leaks, which can affect application performance and stability.

Scenario 5: OutputStream Flush Operation

Details:
  TestName: outputStreamFlushBehavior
  Description: Ensure that flushing MimeCanonicalOutputStream also flushes the underlying OutputStream.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an OutputStream and track its flush operation.
  Act: Create a MimeCanonicalOutputStream with this mock, perform operations, and then flush the MimeCanonicalOutputStream.
  Assert: Verify that the flush method on the mocked OutputStream was called.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if MimeCanonicalOutputStream correctly delegates the flush operation to the underlying stream. Flushing streams is crucial for ensuring that all buffered data is written out, which is particularly important in network or file operations.
